LICENSE FOR INCLUDED PRODUCTS

sigplus ships with a number of other contributed products that have
their separate licenses. These add-on products are located in the
directory "engines" inside the sigplus installation directory. You must
abide by the terms of these additional licenses if you wish to fully
utilize the features of sigplus. If you decline to accept a particular
license, you must delete the corresponding products from the "engines"
folder. Since sigplus is modular, it will automatically recognize the
absence of that particular feature but the rest of the distribution will
operate normally.

boxplus, hoverplus and slideplus are governed by separate licenses and
are not subject to the license applicable to sigplus. They may be
modified freely for use in a particular domain but any redistribution of
products derived from them is not permitted. Redistribution in unaltered
form as part of the sigplus distribution is allowed. For details,
consult the respective licenses of these products.

Once sigplus is installed, included products and their respective
license files can be found in the folder "/media/engines" relative to
the Joomla root directory.
